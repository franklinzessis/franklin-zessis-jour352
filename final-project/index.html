                        I imagine it must have been difficult to grow too
                        attached to your favorite gladiator if you lived in
                        ancient Rome. No matter how many times you came out to
                        the Colosseum to enjoy a bit of bloodsport and cheer on
                        your preferred champion, there was always the chance
                        that your guy, tough and skilled though he may be, was
                        not making it out of that arena with his life.

                    <p>
                        Modern sports are much less barbaric than those enjoyed
                        by denizens of the Appian Way, but violence and injury
                        are still omnipresent in the athletic pursuits we enjoy.
                        It's true that sports are making strides even today to
                        be safer than they were in the relatively near past, but
                        while the days of Dick Butkus sending someone to the
                        hospital with a bone-crunching tackle or Bob Gibson
                        throwing fastballs at opposing batters' heads are gone,
                        there are still many other ways that our favorite
                        athletes can be taken off the field of play.

                        Baseball would probably not have been my first choice
                        when thinking of which major sport would have the most
                        worrisome injury epidemic, but that's exactly where we
                        are at this moment in time. Football and basketball,
                        where athletes are constantly getting bigger, faster and
                        stronger, still have issues with torn ACLs, Achilles'
                        tendons and concussions, but that's nothing compared to
                        the rise in baseball players, specifically pitchers,
                        that are missing time due to injury.

                        The baseball season is only two weeks old, and already

                        number of top pitchers that are either missing time due
                        to elbow inflammation or have already been ruled out for
                        the year and possibly longer with tears in their ulnar

                        As baseball and the players association have bickered
                        over who is to blame (injured Yankees ace Gerrit Cole is
                        quoted in the article as saying, "It's like we have
                        divorced parents"), it seems that each side is more
                        interested in villainizing the other than actually
                        solving the problem.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Players have blamed the pitch clock, implemented last
                        year in an attempt to speed up the game, as the culprit
                        behind all of these injuries, but Adler's interview with
                        elbow surgeon Dr. Keith Meister reveals a common thread
                        tying -- or should I say stitching -- most injured aces
                        together: the sweeper.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Until about a year ago, I'd never heard of a sweeper,
                        and I've been an avid baseball fan all my life. I
                        brushed aside the rising popularity of the term as just
                        a fancy new word for a slider, but that's not really
                        what it is. A sweeper acts similarly to a slider but
                        with even more break. Achieving that extra break has a
                        cost though: more wear and tear on the arm of the
                        pitcher, which leads to more injuries.

                        Throwing a baseball is already an unnatural motion.
                        We've all seen photos of pitchers in mid-delivery, their
                        arms contorted at impossible angles as they release the
                        ball, and wonder how their arm doesn't simply detach
                        from their bodies altogether on their follow-through.
                    </p>

                    <p>Just look at this:</p>

                        This photo from the 2021 World Series features former
                        Rays ace Tyler Glasnow with his arm bent in a way that
                        seems to defy physics. In retrospect, it's no surprise
                        that the next year, Glasnow would undergo Tommy John
                        surgery, costing himself nearly two years in the
                        process. He's been excellent in four starts this year
                        with his new team, the Dodgers, but fans now feel like
                        they're waiting with bated breath for his next stop on
                        the shelf.

                    <p>
                        It should be noted that Glasnow has been vocal in
                        support of pitchers being able to use "sticky stuff" to
                        help them achieve the kind of spin rate that we're
                        talking about here without taxing their bodies as much.
                        This was made a point of emphasis in 2021, shortly
                        before Glasnow got hurt, with the league going so far as
                        to conduct checks on pitchers during games to make sure
                        they weren't using anything to enhance their grip. Maybe
                        this needs to be revisited in light of the increase in
                        pitcher injuries since the sticky stuff ban was enacted.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Let's stick with Glasnow and his new team for a moment
                        longer just to illustrate how dire the situation has
                        become. The Dodgers are baseball's most stacked team,
                        and what's amazing is that they're missing most of their
                        best pitchers because of elbow injuries. Shohei Ohtani
                        won't pitch until at least next year after his elbow
                        surgery in September. Young fireballer Dustin May went
                        under the knife in July. Tony Gonsolin is also out until
                        2025 after undergoing Tommy John in September, and staff
                        ace Walker Buehler still isn't back from his own Tommy
                        John surgery in 2022. This is just one team!
                    </p>

                    <h4>
                        It seems that nobody in baseball is incentivized to put
                        an end to the quest for more velocity and more break.

                        In Adler's article, she quotes Driveline Baseball's
                        director of pitching Chris Langin as saying, “The ways
                        that you would lower the injury risk are also the ways
                        you’d be lowering the player's value. At the end of the
                        day, that’s not the business we’re in.”

                        Baseball insider Ken Rosenthal disputed the validity of
                        this Faustian bargain in a recent episode of Foul
                        Territory, asking how it's in the best interest of teams
                        to constantly lose pitchers for over a year at a time,
                        or for pitchers themselves to constantly go under the
                        knife. I'm in agreement, but like Rosenthal, I also
                        don't know how we can stop pitchers from pushing
                        themselves over the limit in order to reach the big
                        leagues, earn a big free agent contract, or chase a Cy
                        Young. No matter what level a pitcher is at, there will
                        always be an incentive to reach for more and more and
                        more.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The whole situation reminds me a bit of the steroid era,
                        when players tried to get ahead or stay competitive by
                        juicing. This had the snowball effect of incentivizing
                        other players to do the same. "If this guy juiced and
                        set records but I'm a better player, why shouldn't I do
                        it too?" Barry Bonds reportedly was tempted to cheat in
                        part by the adulation that Mark McGwire and Sammy Sosa
                        received for their home run chase in 1998. Baseball
                        contracts are guaranteed, so if an extra couple miles of
                        hour on your fastball and some extra RPMs (Revolutions
                        Per Minute) on your breaking ball can get you an eight-
                        or nine-figure deal, it's tough to argue that a pitcher
                        shouldn't do it, especially when, unlike steroids,
                        increasing pitcher performance in this way is perfectly
                        legal.

                        Just like steroid users, pitchers that are pushing
                        themselves to the brink are justifying it as necessary
                        to keep up with the rest of baseball. There are, of
                        course, key differences between the steroid epidemic and
                        the Tommy John epidemic, namely the health risks, which
                        come in the form of ligament tears for pitchers but
                        longer-term, hormonal issues for steroid users.

                        Steroid users also had to reconcile the ethical issues
                        with skirting the rules, whereas pitchers nowadays
                        aren't faced with any such quandary in trying to keep
                        competitive. It's profoundly sad, though, that the
                        choice for many pitchers is either to push themselves to
                        the breaking point or get left behind. All top athletes
                        make sacrifices to master their craft, but virtually
                        guaranteeing serious injury in order to remain
                        competitive is a bridge too far.

                        The shame of it all is that even without taking into
                        account the rash of pitching injuries across MLB,
                        pitching is in a worse place than it used to be. How can
                        this be when there's such a drive to max out
                        performance? It's because arms are not meant to give max
                        effort, pitch after pitch. As a result, starters rarely
                        make it past the fifth or sixth inning anymore. Complete
                        games are practically extinct. The Mets have played 11
                        games so far, and already there have been two games in
                        which they had at least three bullpen arms unavailable
                        because they'd already pitched multiple days in a row.
                        How can any staff ever expect to get through a 162-game
                        season?

                        Players are trading their bodies for glory and that next
                        big payday, and teams are willingly sacrificing them in
                        the interest of short-term gains. The rise of the
                        sweeper and the push for more velocity are bad for
                        baseball, but does anyone care enough to do something
                        about it? Maybe the age of the gladiator isn't actually
                        dead after all. As fans, maybe we just shouldn't grow
                        too attached.
